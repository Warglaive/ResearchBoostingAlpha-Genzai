PRE-KYC Solutions:
https://seon.io/pricing/
- We don't provide traditional KYC checks (ID verification, etc.), with our solution you can filter junk users, bad leads, and obvious fraudsters so in a way youâ€™re already saving costs and resources before the real KYC checks even begin.
Our tool's primary goal is to detect fraud, but it could be implemented and could help with your KYC process. It is a soft or pre-KYC method


Best fits so far:
